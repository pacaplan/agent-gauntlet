# Quick Start

## Requirements

- **Bun** (Required runtime, v1.0.0+)
- **git** (change detection and diffs)
- For reviews: one or more supported AI CLIs installed (`gemini`, `codex`, `claude`, `github-copilot`, `cursor`). For the full list of tools and how they are used, see [CLI Invocation Details](cli-invocation-details.md)

## Installation

You can install `agent-gauntlet` globally using `npm` or `bun` (Bun must be installed on the system in both cases):

**Using Bun (Recommended):**
```bash
bun add -g agent-gauntlet
```

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm install -g agent-gauntlet
```

## Initialization

Initialize configuration in your project root:

```bash
agent-gauntlet init
```

This creates the `.gauntlet/` directory with:
- Configuration files for checks, reviews, and entry points (see [Configuration Layout](#configuration-layout))
- `run_gauntlet.md` — agent loop rules for the `/gauntlet` command

Optionally, the interactive setup can also install `/gauntlet` as a slash command for your AI agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.).

## Configuration Concepts

Agent Gauntlet uses three core concepts:

- **Entry points**: Paths in your repository (e.g., `src/`, `docs/plans/`) that Gauntlet monitors for changes.
- **Checks**: Shell commands that run when an entry point changes — things like tests, linters, and type-checkers.
- **Reviews**: AI-powered code reviews requested via CLI tools like Codex, Claude, or Gemini. Each review uses a custom prompt you define.

When you run `agent-gauntlet`, it detects which entry points have changed files and runs the associated checks and reviews.

## Basic Usage

- **Run gates for detected changes**

```bash
agent-gauntlet run
```

## Agent Loop Rules

The `.gauntlet/run_gauntlet.md` file defines how AI agents should interact with the gauntlet. By default, agents will terminate after 4 runs (1 initial + 3 fix attempts). You can increase this limit by manually editing the termination conditions in that file.

## Configuration Layout

Agent Gauntlet loads configuration from your repository:

```text
.gauntlet/
  config.yml
  checks/
    *.yml
  reviews/
    *.md
```

- **Project config**: `.gauntlet/config.yml`
- **Check definitions**: `.gauntlet/checks/*.yml`
- **Review definitions**: `.gauntlet/reviews/*.md` (filename is the review name)

## Example Configuration

Here's a real-world configuration from the Agent Gauntlet project itself:

### config.yml

```yaml
base_branch: origin/main
log_dir: .gauntlet_logs
allow_parallel: true
cli:
  default_preference:
    - codex
    - claude
    - gemini
  check_usage_limit: true
entry_points:
  - path: "src"
    checks:
      - test
      - lint
      - security-code
    reviews:
      - code-quality
  - path: "package.json"
    checks:
      - security-deps
  - path: "internal-docs/plans"
    reviews:
      - plan-review
```

**What each section does:**

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `base_branch` | The branch to compare against when detecting changes (usually `origin/main`) |
| `log_dir` | Where Gauntlet writes log files for each run |
| `allow_parallel` | Run checks and reviews concurrently for faster feedback |
| `cli.default_preference` | Ordered list of AI CLIs to try for reviews — uses the first available one |
| `cli.check_usage_limit` | Skip CLIs that have hit their token/usage limit |
| `entry_points` | Maps paths to the checks and reviews that run when those paths change |

In this example:
- Changes to `src/` trigger tests, linting, security checks, **and** an AI code review
- Changes to `package.json` trigger a dependency security audit
- Changes to `internal-docs/plans/` trigger an AI plan review (no code checks needed)

### Check definition example

Checks are shell commands defined in `.gauntlet/checks/*.yml`:

```yaml
# .gauntlet/checks/lint.yml
name: lint
command: bunx biome check src
working_directory: .
parallel: true
run_in_ci: true
run_locally: true
timeout: 60
```

The check name (`lint`) is referenced in `config.yml`. When Gauntlet runs this check, it executes the `command` and reports pass/fail based on exit code.

### Review definition example

Reviews are prompts defined in `.gauntlet/reviews/*.md`:

```markdown
# .gauntlet/reviews/code-quality.md

# Code Review

Review the diff for code quality issues. Focus on:
- Code correctness and potential bugs
- Code style and consistency
- Best practices and maintainability
- Performance considerations
```

The filename (`code-quality.md`) becomes the review name referenced in `config.yml`. Gauntlet passes this prompt — along with the diff of changed files — to the AI CLI.

**Per-review CLI preference:** You can override the default CLI preference for specific reviews using YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
cli_preference:
  - gemini
  - codex
---

# Plan Review
Review this plan for completeness and potential issues.
```

This is useful when you want a specific LLM for certain types of reviews — for example, using Gemini for plan reviews but Codex for code reviews.

## Logs

Each job writes a log file under `log_dir` (default: `.gauntlet_logs/`). Filenames are derived from the job id (sanitized).
